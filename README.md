# Welcome to My Portfolio Repository

Here you will see all the projects I have worked on. I have experience in JavaScript, SQLite, and more. I am passionate about the creation of web Apps. I am always looking for new projects to work on and new things to learn. I am currently working on improving my skills in deep learning and natural language processing. Please feel free to reach out to me if you would like to work on a project together, have any feedback, or just want to connect.
